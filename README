The ``gentabs`` module extends the Nimrod standard ``strtabs`` module but extends
it to allow other than strings to be stored in the table.  The keys are required
to be strings, but the values may be any Nimrod or user defined type.  This module
supports matching of keys in case-sensitive, case-insensitive and style-insensitive
modes.

Note: This module (or the compiler) is broken!!!  The test cases in the ``gentabs``
module file run correctly for basic Nimrod data types as well as user-defined types
(for the most part).  It fails, however, on tables-of-tables.  That is, you cannot
embed a gentab table in a gentab table.  Caveat:  Actually you can but accessing
the stored table within a loop using ``pairs`` seems to fail.  That is, 

for k,v in pairs(z):
  for k2,v2 in pairs(v):
    echo( "$#: $# <-> $#" % [k, k2,$v2] )

does not compile ("Error: execution of an external program failed").

If you stay away from tables-of-tables it seems OK though.
